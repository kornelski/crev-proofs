notes = """
I wrote this crate, so this review is a reflection as a result of writing the
code and then reviewing it again for this review.

While the aho-corasick crate is not often used directly, it is a key
optimization technique used in the `regex` crate for quickly finding
potential matches by searching literals.

I gave this crate a rating of `positive` instead of the highest `strong`
because it was somewhat recently rewritten. So it hasn't been thoroughly
vetted yet.

At a higher level, one concern point of this crate is that it has a lot of
`unsafe` usage. While a small number of those `unsafe` uses are for the
Aho-Corasick algorithm itself---mostly for explicitly eliding bounds checks
for performance reasons---the vast majority of all `unsafe` uses are for the
implementation of the Teddy algorithm, which makes heavy use of SIMD through
explicit CPU specific vendor intrinsics. The Teddy algorithm is used as a
fast prefilter to quickly find potential matches when searching for a smaller
number of patterns. The speedups can be an order of magnitude, so the extra
code complexity is worth it.

As with the memchr crate, both the Aho-Corasick algorithm and the Teddy
algorithm are thoroughly tested. Both are tested independently of one another
and when they are used together. Like the memchr crate, the Teddy
algorithm is tested on a wide variety of haystack configurations to test
different haystack lengths and match positions, all of which can exercise
different aspects of the Teddy algorithm. If one counted the total number of
tests for the entire crate (including variations on each), it would easily
be in the tens of thousands.

Good characteristics (compared to other instrumented allocators):

* Allocation numbers are tracked per-thread, which means that it can be
  used in parallel tests reliably.

Limitations (compared to other instrumented allocators):

* Not generic; always delegates to the `System` allocator.
* Declares `#[global_allocator]` itself, so whether it is used depends
  on whether the crate is linked, not on code in the dependent crate.

Bugs noticed during review:

* Counts failed allocations as if they succeeded.
* `measure(f)` does not clean up state if `f()` panics.
* If the allocation tracking stack overflows, the counter will be left
  incremented, which I think will cause future allocations to panic.

None of those bugs affect safety.

I made this review while searching for an instrumented allocator I could
use in tests, and others I have evaluated are
<https://docs.rs/stats_alloc/0.1.10/> and <https://docs.rs/logging-allocator/0.1.1/>."""

Probably sound as of 0.4.11 on Rust 1.36.0+?
Uses a disturbing amount of unsafe, but aside from uninitialized! use in ArrayVec 1.35 and earlier, it all at least appears to be correct after a careful reading.
Unlike smallvec, this doesn't fall back on the heap.
Better than whatever you'll write rolling your own, at least.

0.4.7  -> 0.4.8:  IntoIter implemented Clone, unconcerning
0.4.8  -> 0.4.9:  ArrayString initialized to 0, ArrayVec uses nightly MaybeUninit.  Unfortunately stable still uses uninitialized!() so this is still negative.
0.4.9  -> 0.4.10: #[repr(C)], -Clone for MaybeUninit.  Apparently I missed more possible unsoundness.  Unsafe is hard.
0.4.10 -> 0.4.11: ArrayVec should now also be sound in Rust 1.36.0+, probably, maybe.

* No direct disk I/O

Cons:
* Exahustively matchable structs make most version bumps technically breaking changes
* Requires non-default export options (fixed in an unmerged PR)
* Enum deserialization is brittle when it comes to new options

The crate gained quite a bit of interface since last time. I'm not quite sure
how I feel about this at the moment but understanding definitely suffered
from it.

Of most concern is definitely `TransparentWrapper` which relies on the
internal implementation detail that the layout of a pointer type itself does
not change for transparent wrappers. This premise seems a very unlikely to be
invalidated from changes but nevertheless departs with only relying on
stabilized and fully RFCed properties.

Other than that, no critical changes and a continued trend of being cautious.
Notably the implementation of Contiguous guards against bad implementations
despite being unsafe to implement, the `offset_of` macro is completely
safe(!)—a welcome change for such macros—and there are MIRI tests in CI.

The test suite could be a lot bigger but some tests are obviously foiled by
MIRI rejecting some sound and UB-free code that relies on alignment checks,
to avoid those incidentally succeeding in unsound code."""

The implementation is rather conservative on many fronts and requires very
strong, sometimes even unnecessary, preconditions for all operations. But
this makes reasoning easier since you work with a consistent set of
assumptions. This is in contrast to `zerocopy` which has at three differing
sets.

The biggest leap of unsafety is the assumption that slices strides and arrays
agree with the size of their elements. This is not quite likely to change,
ever, but it should be noted nevertheless. The exact wording of `Pod` also
allows us to smuggle a type through its requirements. It takes some care to
try and only allow types that might violate the assumption by requiring a
defined `repr` but in its wording forgets that `repr(packed)` can be applied
to `repr(rust)`. Thus, the following type conforms to the wording but not the
spirit behind it.

```
\#[repr(packed)] struct BadSize(u16, u8)
```

The easiest fix would be to explicitly list the requirement that the size is
divisible by the alignment. This defines the stride to agree with the size.

Provides methods for encoding and decoding numbers in big-endian and
little-endian order.

This is a widely used, very well tested, high quality crate.

There are two kinds of unsafe blocks:

(1) Integer/IEEE754 floating point casting. After bumping MSRV to 1.20.0
some of these can be avoided by using {f32,f64}::from_bits() from the
standard library.

(2) Slice casting (via pointers). It seems to assume that for example u32,
i32 and f32 have compatible alignment, which is probably valid. Maybe this
should be noted in a comment."""

Parse `cargo metadata` and `cargo build --message-format=json` output.

Pros:
* Way better than parsing it yourself
* Safe code

Cons:
* If you're feeling particularly paranoid, `cargo metadata` could be passed bad
  feature names (see 0.8.2 review for details)

Contains several flaws leading to Undefined Behavior in purely safe Rust code.
Here are the instances of UB I uncovered:

CFArray::from_copyable can trivially lead to reading uninitialized memory if
the T type argument is not pointer sized. This is GH issue \#291.

In many places, NULL checks are missing entirely, leading to types assumed to
be safe by construction to be created with a NULL pointer, trivially leading
to crashes. This is especially the case in almost every allocating types.
Tracked at GH issue \#361.

CFMutableDictionary has multiple issues allowing one to trivially cause UB by
calling add with arbitrary pointers. Furthermore, the CFMutableDictionary
constructor calls `CFDictionaryCreateMutable` with the
`kCFTypeDictionary*CallBacks`, causing issues if non-CFTypes are inserted into
the dictionary. This is not, however, ensured at the type level. Tracked at
GH issue \#362.

TCFType is a safe trait that should be implemented on the safe Core Foundation
type wrappers. Many functions assume that a type implementing TCFType is in
fact core-foundation managed, despite the trait being safe to implement. This
can trivially cause UB simply by calling the default `retain_count()` on
a broken implementation, or by passing a broken implementation to
`CFArray::from_CFTypes`. This is tracked at \#364.'''

Has fuzzing integration and been scrutinized by a previous review. I've done
version 0.1.2 in some detail and the only changes merged since then are bug
fix PRs addressing those. Mostly worried about inadvertently introduced bugs
in future changes due to awkward interfaces and implicit trust between
different components within the code.

For example, code in `struct_item.rs` relies on the reader providing only 4
byte aligned buffers instead of reasserting that fact as an internal
invariant. However this invariant is relied upon for an aligned pointer load
later.

Similarly some other C style patterns are prominent. Instead of functions
testing an invariant and constructing a result based off of it, boolean
return and construction by the caller is used. Example:

```
      self.assert_enough_struct(offset, desc_size)?;

      let desc_be = unsafe {
          &*((&self.struct_block[offset..]).as_ptr() as *const PropertyDesc)
              as &PropertyDesc
      };
```

This is fine in its current usage as far as I can tell but it's not very
stable with regards to possible future changes.

This also means that manual arithmetic is used for bounds checks which is
prone to missed overflow considerations etc.

A remaining antipattern is that of a byte output buffer: `StructItem` offers
reading its value as strings or a `u32` list. But instead of an iterator over
the backing memory the implementation takes an mutable reference to a byte
slice, manually aligns it to fit the output type, casts it, and writes the
data types `&'_ str` and `u32`. I have not found concrete misbehaviour from
this but it seems awkward.

Liberal use of `unsafe` and sparse validation of in puts indices and offsets.
In principle, the dtb format lends itself well to this use as the file format
itself already requires the alignment of many members and takes care to have
naturally packed structs–with aligned members but no padding.

It is thus possibly safe to map many parts of an immutable input directly to
structs marked as `repr(C)`, which also correctly appears.

However, the `unsafe` blocks contain only few indications of consideration of
their safety. Sometimes alignment checks appear obviously above but most
iterators implicitely trust their callers on the alignment of internal
buffers. It also seems that not all functions relying on `unsafe`
preconditions are marked `unsafe`. This applies to internal functions only
but may make the crate more brittle than necessary.

Another antipattern is that of a byte output buffer: A `StructItem` offers
reading its value as strings or a `u32` list. But instead of an iterator over
the backing memory the implementation takes an mutable reference to a byte

I am the author of this crate. As such, I obviously trust it and believe it is useful.
So this review will instead point at the trickiest parts and try to rationalize them.

ErasedPtr is a trivial typedef.
Erasable is an unsafe trait, but an obvious one.

ErasablePtr is a tricky trait, as it encodes the requirements to make Thin work properly.
The methods functionality it provides is self-evident, but the Thin requirements are subtle.
Specifically, ErasablePtr requires Deref and DerefMut to \"behave\" to make Thin::with(_mut) sound.
It needs to be sound to take an erased pointer, convert it back to the real pointer temporarily,
dereference the real pointer, trash the temporary real pointer, and then use the resulting ref.
This is the requirement laid out by usage with Thin and described generally by the documentation.

Because of the simplicity of the actual functionality, the actual implementations of ErasablePtr
(as well as Erasable) are almost trivially correct, just type erasing and casting the type back.

Thin is the real scary `unsafe` involved. It relies on the guarantees promised by ErasablePtr
to treat an ErasedPtr as if it were the real, invariant-holding pointer.
The unsafe points are Thin::with, Thin::with_mut, Thin::deref, and Thin::deref_mut.
Thin::with is sound because of the no-shared-mutability-before-indirection requirement,
meaning that the created undropped temporary is a fine substitue for the real pointer.
Thin::with_mut adds the possiblity of mutability-before-indirection, and uses a scope guard
to ensure that the potentially mutated pointer is re-erased and re-stored as the thin pointer.
The Deref and DerefMut impls then rely on the address-independent-deref semantics to tie the
lifetime of the deref'd reference to the erased pointer rather than the temporary real pointer.
The only chance for mutability-before-indirection is in the pointer's own DerefMut impl,
and the use of Thin::with_mut to deref the real pointer ensures that this is properly respected.
The remaining impls on Thin just forward trait impls, as is done for pointers in std.

Note, however, that Thin actually provides little/no actual benefits without an additional
library (slice-dst), because all erasable pointers provided by this crate are already thin.

Smoke tests are run under miri, but the crate could potentially do with some more examples
as well as some more tests to ensure that all of the functionality works as advertised.

Some completely dead code was left in, but has been patched out of the git head,
and a patch version will be released that removes the unneeded dead code.

I've only put this review as positive rather than strong because of a lack of real-world use.
As of yet, the library is just of theoretical use, and has yet to be stress tested for real.
However, I feel perfectly fine recommending it for any/all use case that wants to make working
with type-erased pointers simpler, or uses slice-dst and wants thin pointers to those structures."""

This is a preliminary \"does this look okay to use\" code review, writing down
everything I noticed -- I have not yet attempted to use the library.

## Build

Good.

* Has `no_std` support, in the conventional fashion of a `std` feature that
  can be disabled.
* Depends only on common interop libraries, and optionally `libm`.
  All dependencies are optional except `num-traits`.

## API design

Dubious in places.

* `Rect::inner_rect()` contains a `debug_assert!` that the size of the result is
  not negative, yet this is not an invariant of the type, and the potential panic
  is not documented.
* The `approxord` module contains no items that match its module docs, just
  `max()` and `min()` for `PartialOrd` rather than only `Ord`.

The following are “this doesn't exist” rather than “this exists but is bad”:

* `Angle` and `Rotation2D` type are specifically radians.
  This prevents some opportunities for exact arithmetic on fractions or multiples
  of whole turns (because 360 is a rational number and 2π is not).
* There is no `Vector4D` type, only the specific-purpose `HomogeneousVector`.

## Documentation

* Many functions without docs or with not very specific docs.
* `cast()` methods have an un-`track_caller`ed panic if the underlying
  `num_traits::NumCast` fails. On the ones which have documentation at all
  (e.g. `Length`), the description of `cast()` and `try_cast()` as \"Cast\" and
  \"Fallible cast\" respectively might lead the reader to think that the former
  is an infallible conversion, not a panicking one.

## Code

* Clippy lint directives in an archaic style from before they were namespaced:
  `#![cfg_attr(feature = \"cargo-clippy\", allow(just_underscores_and_digits))]`
* Superfluous `use mint;` items.
* `approxeq.rs`:
  Default epsilons are a dubious concept in the first place, but
  particularly, using 1e-6 for f64 as well as f32 seems a bit lax.
* `rigid.rs`:
  \"All matrix multiplication in this module is in row-vector notation,\" which
  seems gratuitously inconsistent with most common notation and with the
  `transform2d` and `transform3d` modules. But perhaps I have misunderstood."""

Generates random numbers using Wyrand algorithm (which is not
cryptographically secure, but ostensibly passes some popular tests — I didn't
verify that).

No `unsafe`, no dependencies other than std (except on WASM, where it pulls
in `instant` crate to get initial entropy).

By default, the generator is initialized from a hash of
std::time::Instant::now() and process ID. Good enough for a non-cryptographic
PRNG.

Interesting detail: if the thread-local storage has already been
de-initialized by we try to use it, the generator is initialized by a fixed
seed 0x4d595df4d0f33173. This constant is an initial state for PCG-XSH-RR,
which is an algorithm that previous versions of the crate used.

I verified that the algorithms match the documents they reference:
- Wyrand implementation matches `wyrand()` in
  https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash/blob/master/wyhash.h at commit
  399078afad15f65ec86836e1c3b0a103d178f15b
- random shuffling matches
  https://lemire.me/blog/2016/06/30/fast-random-shuffling/
- 128-bit multiplication matches
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28868367/getting-the-high-part-of-64-bit-integer-multiplication/28904636#28904636

I also verified that the algorithms that generate floating-point numbers
indeed do what they're supposed to do: set sign to 0 (i.e. positive),
exponent to 127 (i.e. zero), then fill the fraction with random bits, and
subtracting 1.0 from the result to get [0; 1).

Also worth mentioning that the crate doesn't guarantee a specific algorithm,
so you shouldn't depend on a specific seed to always produce the same
results.

Recommended for non-cryptographic purposes that do not require
reproducibility."""

Looks nice and solid.  Well documented, well tested, code coverage, safe + sound.
Large crate - so I haven't taken the time to thoroughly audit everything - but I have at least skimmed over all code.
I've written some of my own partial DWARF parser in C++ in the past... parts look appropriately familiar.

Handle basic #include s for GLSL.

Pros:
* 100% Safe/Sandboxed

Cons:
* No `#file` directives emitted
* No callback option for `#include`, must pre-register all possible includes.
* Repeat #include s simply ignored instead of interacting with preprocessor.

The code is trivial and looks good enough for creating hashes given already
hashed data, at least for non-security related scenarios.

There might be some cases where the given hashes don't use the full range of
u64, though (in case a structure of several small fields is used, for
example). This might lead to suboptimal distribution and collisions in a
HashMap and might come as some surprise. On the other hand, anything without
this problem would probably require something more complex and likely slower
and this seems to aim for things like bittorrent hashes and git commits,

avoided (e.g. copying strings, taking strings instead of slices in an API,
collecting parts into Vec<String> after splitting, etc). That's not an issue

std::time::Instant alternative that doesn't panic on wasm targets.

Pros:
- Doesn't panic!
- Just std::time::Instant on native, no performance hit or anything

Cons:
- Just std::time::Instant on native, easy to accidentally use new std APIs unavailable on wasm
- f64 repr for Instant makes me nervous
- Unusual license choice for rust projects
- Could use more test coverage

Good solid FFI crate.  Manual generation (I see comments!) concerns me, but upon review it looks to have been done correctly.

Verified all structs and FFI signatures against android JNI.h, with the exception of double checking that *everything* is marked JNICALL on windows JNI instead of just most of it.
Android JNI lacks parameter names, so I didn't sanity check those either.
Verified against %LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\ndk-bundle\toolchains\llvm\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\sysroot\usr\include\jni.h

| 7     | +1    | Looks sufficiently correct to me - VS defines this as *mut c_char, but *mut c_void is close enough IMO.

| 57    | +1    | |
| 64    | -1    | DANGER - rust enum for C enum is begging for unsound if returned from FFI
| 71    | +1    | JNI constants here all look good
| 93    | 0     | JNINativeMethod - C version uses const char*, but the muts here aren't a *big* deal... I
| 99    | +1    | |
| 105   | +1    | JNINativeInterface is bloody huge, but all methods appear to match in name, position, and signature... |
| 115   |       | ...with the caveat that there's a lot of "system" convention when JNICALL isn't used throughout the android jni.h.  However, it *is* used in openjdk so that's probably fine?
| 116   |       | I'm also assuming `Option<unsafe extern "system" fn(...) -> ...>` is FFI compatible with C function pointers, which might be a bad assumption. |
| 157   |       | Native version isn't marked no return but I bet it is.
| 175   |       | Also, varargs functions degrade to "C" mode per https://stackoverflow.com/a/3615407

Disclaimer, I'm the author

This crate handles parsing Valve's Data Format (VDF or KeyValues) into an
untyped structure. The parsing is backed by Pest without any real surprises
(the complicated parts being mapping the returned parsed object to a rust
structure. A bit annoying that this has to be done manually)

Verification-wise there are several places that could panic, but there is a
fuzzing suite to try and exercise code-paths that should be unreachable.

The only reason that I'm opting for positive over strong is because I know
that there are several VDF files that fail parsing (which should improve on
the next release), and I'm not confident that there aren't more files that
would also have issues since VDF doesn't really have a specification that is
followed :("""

Has unsoundness in a major, safe interface.

The main utility for Vec can reuse an allocation of differing element size
thus violating the explicit requirements of Vec::from_raw_parts and in
particular the allocator contract, potentially leading to memory corruption
on drop of the resulting Vec.

The interface affected are (maybe not complete):
  * `MapVecInPlace::map`
  * `MapVecInPlace::map_in_place`
  * `MapVecInPlace::filter_map`
  * `MapVecInPlace::filter_map_in_place`

An analysis of the code to show the issue:

In a macro, this code checks for various size and alignment constraints on
deciding whether to execute an in-place branch or a fallback (that may panic
in some variants).

  unsafe {
      if size!($a) == 0  ||  size!($b) == 0 {
          $zero
      } else if align!($a) != align!($b) {
          $alignment
      } else if $f(size!($a),size!($b)) {
          $incompatible
      } else {
          $ok
      }
  }

Already a naming issue appears, as the `$incompatible` branch is actually
taken when `f` returns `true` and some instantiation has `|a,b| a==b` as this
argument. Consequently, the `incompatible` parameter is filled with the
in-place branch in the `fallback` branch where the parameter is `$ok:expr`

Note that the check for `map` is `|a,b| a%b==0` and it invokes `$fallback`
with the `$ok:expr` argument set to `map_vec(self, f)` (note: the `f` here is
from the parameters of `map`). The `map_vec` function is an `unsafe` function
eventually doing the equivalent of

  let (ptr, len, cap) = /* The obvious */;
  // Some transformation code on `raw`.
  Vec::from_raw_parts(ptr, len, cap)

This violates very clearly the contract which states:

> `ptr`'s T needs to have *the same* size and alignment as it was allocated with

I wrote this crate, so this review is a reflection as a result of writing
the code and then reviewing it again for this review.

The entire purpose of the memchr crate is to do this:

    haystack.iter().position(|&b| b == needle)

... but really fast. As a result, this crate uses SIMD via CPU specific
vendor intrinsics. Consequently, there is a lot of unsafe code in this
crate. There is really no way to avoid this, other than perhaps using a
higher level platform independent SIMD API. But no such thing of sufficient
quality exists for stable Rust at the time of writing.

The testing strategy is the most important bit here. In particular, every
public API item is tested using a permutation of tests that exercise all
possible alignments found in a haystack. (Because the implementations used
aligned loads/stores, which are only correct if the address arithmetic is
correct.) Additionally, there are quickcheck tests that act as a sort of
fuzzer guaranteeing that the implementation is correct for a range of inputs.

I gave the highest rating possible because of the extensive use this crate
has seen, in addition to its level of testing. In particular, memchr
underlies a significant chunk of all text search in the Rust ecosystem.

A very straightforward library. Some complaints one could have about it:

* No type documentation.
  [Some was contributed but the PR stalled](https://github.com/kvark/mint/pull/36).
* Contains use of `unsafe` code, to provide `&`/`&mut` access to different
  interpretations of the same type (e.g. a quaternion as either
  `{Vector3<T>, T}` or as `[T; 4]`). I believe the unsafe code is correct,
  even in the presence of unusual choices of `T`."""

Queries the OS for the number of CPU cores you have.

Pros:
*   You didn't have to write it.
*   Handles all that hideously platform specific nonsense for you.

Cons:
*   Lots of (necessary) `unsafe`
*   Linux cgroups support seems wildly overcomplicated.
*   [Lies](https://github.com/seanmonstar/num_cpus/issues/95) and
    [lies](https://github.com/seanmonstar/num_cpus/issues/69) and
    [lies](https://github.com/seanmonstar/num_cpus/issues/34) and
    [lies](https://github.com/seanmonstar/num_cpus/issues/81).
    Not exactly this crate's fault - the system APIs are brittle and full of edge cases.
    Multi-processor **architectures** are full of edge cases.

Alternatives:
*   Just hardcode a reasonable number of threads for your workload!
    Spinning up threads for 64 CPU cores to all false-share a single cacheline
    because that's how many logical cores were detected isn't the right choice!
    And all your threads are probably blocked on I/O anyways!

On a quick skim, \"this sure looks like a PNG decoder\":
all the code is a reasonable kind of code for what it says it does,
but I have not reviewed it for correctness.

I have also confirmed its functionality as a replacement for `image`'s
PNG support in my use case with a few small static PNGs.

Good things:

* There is no `unsafe` code.
* It seems to be taking care to return decoding errors rather than
  panicking, and the fuzz testing set up in the repository should be
  detecting such cases.

Potentially problematic:

* It allocates an amount of memory determined by the input image
  (using `Vec::with_capacity()`) without checks, so a malicious image
  could DoS via excessive memory use (zip bomb attack)."""

I am the author of this crate. As such, I obviously trust it and believe it is useful.
So this review will instead point at the trickiest parts and try to rationalize them.

Don't believe cargo-geiger for this crate. The majority of the API is macro-generated,
and cargo-geiger misses unsafe invocations emitted by the complex macro.

This crate makes liberal usage of unreachable_unchecked,
but for cases where the case is trivially actually unreachable.

However, using this crate _will_ decrease the required unsafe for your crate,
as it gives you alignment-tagged pointer unions for only one line of unsafe per union type.
The unsafe burden you take on is to guarantee the alignment required to store the tag within.

Smoke tests are run under miri, but the crate could potentially do with some more examples
as well as some more tests to ensure that all of the functionality works as advertised.

I've only put this review as positive rather than strong because of a lack of real-world use.
As of yet, the library is just of theoretical use, and has yet to be stress tested for real."""

Further, for machines that do not support CPUID (arguably rare, when ignoring
SGX), it incorrectly exposes the unsafe core::arch::__cpuid_count() as a safe
function. (The safety requirement is that the CPUID instruction is supported,
https://github.com/gz/rust-cpuid/issues/41).

Soundness issues aside, there are some minor issues.

Do not believe cargo-geiger for this crate. The implementation is primarily macro-generated,
and cargo-geiger does not see into unsafe generated in macros.

That said, this crate is fairly simple and self-evident.
The main tricky bit is around pointer provenance when reconstructing the (A)Rc.
See <https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/_/11463/11> for some context.
The standard library currently does this wrong, even!
Getting the \"raw\" reference as `&**arc` gives shared immutable provenance,
and (A)Rc requires \"raw mutable\" provenance, because of get_mut.

If you're reading this and you _ever_ upgrade &T to (A)Rc<T>, replace it with this crate!
The crate uses autocfg to automatically probe for the \"fix\" methods of std providing a
(A)Rc::as_raw, so will automatically upgrade to the purely sound version when it's available.

I gave a rating of positive because the implementation in the regex crate has
remain mostly unchanged for a long period of time, so it has matured and been
battle tested. Moreover, the crate uses very little unsafe directly. The
only uses are in the DFA regex engine for explicitly eliding bounds checks
in very hot loops.

A better rating is likely deserved, but there are still a few outstanding
bugs that can produce incorrect matches. In many cases, these bugs are a
result of optimizations using literal searches, which can be subtle and
difficult to get right.

I wrote this crate, so this review is a reflection as a result of writing

The regex-syntax crate is mostly an internal implementation detail of the
regex crate. It is exposed as a stand-alone crate for the occasional use
case where it is convenient to analyze the syntax of a regex. The primary
thing that the regex-syntax crate provides is a parser for the concrete
syntax supported by the `regex` crate.

The regex-syntax crate is very large, but there is no unsafe used anywhere.
Moreover, it has no dependencies. That means that no matter what concrete
syntax is given, the worst that can happen is a panic. Memory safety should
be preserved (modulo bugs in the compiler or the standard library). On top of
that, the parser does not use explicit recursion and enforces a nest depth
by default, so it should generally be safe with respect to arbitrary input.

A longstanding soundness issue of interpreting a user input type `T` as
bytes... This goes back to `0.2` at least where we have the following trait:

  fn as_mut_slice(&mut self) -> &mut [T];

Small, stable, and highly useful.

Most of the code is straightforward but to increase usability there are three
`unsafe` blocks. It seems feasible to write a completely safe version of the
API without hurting the main use case too much. The benefit, however, would
be slim except for those focussed on purging even well-reviewed local
`unsafe`. Let's explain how we agree with all reasoning, and documentation.

src/lib.rs:351:`ScopeGuard::into_inner`: Here it performs a manual move from
a to-be-forgotten value that can't be destructured due to the rules around
Drop types. It's slightly awkward to use `mem::forget` _after_ the copy
instead of wrapping the value in a `ManuallyDrop` at the start but the
comment correctly explains why the order is equivalent and still sound. It
also seems odd that this pseudo-destructuring does not return the function
instance but only the value and thus always drops the functor which
potentially also drops any contained captured value and thus might panic.
That seems more ergonomic in the common case or when a pure function is used,
so it isn't critical.

src/lib.rs:422:`impl Sync`: This is likely the most involved here but the
comment explains it well enough. It might have been/be beneficial to create a
very small newtype wrapper that enforces that no such access by reference can
take place in future versions of the crate also. This would also reduce the
mental load, as this impl with all its type bounds would not be explicitly
required. It would nevertheless not reduce the amount of necessary soundness
reasoning so this is just polish.

src/lib.rs:455:`Drop::drop for ScopeGuard`: Same as `into_inner` but since
this is within the Drop impl there is no need (and possibility) to forget
`self` so this is self-explanatory. This could share a common core with the
`into_inner` method, a private inherent method that `ptr::read`'s the stored
values. Avoiding duplication here would be more important if different ways
of destructuring existed."""

The crate contains no comments on how the supposed constant time operations
are actually achieved. There is no mention of a memory model, no discussion
of references, black boxes, speculation, optimization, etc. And on top of
these theoretical shortcomings the crate also contains no tests to verify any
of their assumptions. This means: no `asm` output review, no smoke tests for
operation's time dependencies and a general lack of even functional tests.

The `classify` method is just a glorified constructor and even contains a
generic which will in general have no guarantees and is totally misplaced
here. And `declassify` doesn't really do anything since the whole type state
can always be dereferenced into the underlying type if the compiler pleases
(and, oh, it will).

An unexplained fill-horn of converters is added. Since they do not perform
any more robust sequencing or basic optimization barriers, one might as well
use the `classify` constructor instead. They are even declared `#[inline]`!

Some allocating to-bytes converters are offered. Despite plainly leaking all
values into the global heap without any protection or zeroing after
expiration, they have no documentation, unlike much less dangerous methods.

Despite the fact that several operations are disallowed as a 'security
feature', an inconsistent other set is allowed. Overflow checked operations
will, almost by definition, at least contain conditional moves if compiled
naively using the built-ins. But for some unexplained reason, the division
operation of all is untrusted!

Many other such ops -- with invalid and panicking inputs or similar -- exist:
Rotations will probably do a branch on the input value, additions overflow
check and complain etc. in debug code. Maybe the bitwise operations are not
totally broken.

WORST! Some operations are transliterated from WireGuard. But they contain
TYPOS that plainly contradict newly introduced variable names. How do they
even work? It is not explained.

By the way, the code is copied from a GPL licensed project (WireGuard) but
the crate itself LOOKS like an MIT license but actually mentions APACHE
within the text. So this might also be a licensing risk for the future.

This is a self-assessment. I am the author of this crate.

Soundness: I am highly confident in soundness. Unfortunately, I could not
avoid two kinds of unsafe blocks, without major performance impact.
Instead, all preconditions are explained thoroughly in comments and asserted
with debug assertions.

(1) The optimizer does not reliably elide bounds checks based on the
assumption that u64::trailing_zeros() will never be larger than 63.
This is important in many hot loops.

(2) The perfect hash function for attack lookups always stays within bounds.
This technique is called Magic Bitboards, widely used and very well
understood in the chess community. When selecting magic factors, exactly this
assumption is tested for all possible inputs.

Correctness: For move generation in standard chess, confidence is based
on a large test suite of randomly generated, as well as historical and tricky
positions, so called perft tests. The numbers are shared in the chess
community and compared across a wide array of implementations.

I am gradually less confident in other features, especially chess variants,
simply because they are less popular and played less often, and Zobrist
hashing, a recent feature addition.

The library has been used to parse 1 billion recorded real world games
(https://database.lichess.org). Some bugs have been found, but in the source
of the data, not this library.

For handling of input formats (FEN, SAN, UCI) I reviewed the code thoroughly
and used fuzz testing to ensure absence of DOS/panics."""

Probes Syzygy tablebases.

This is a self-assessment. I am the author of this crate.

Soundness: The crate uses no unsafe code. Unlike existing implementations in
C/C++, I made a deliberate choice to use the safer pread instead of mmap,
despite performance costs.

Panics/DOS: I carefully reviewed the code to ensure that all loops and
all recursion is bounded. I used fuzz testing to simulate corrupted tablebase
files. Nonetheless, it is best to verify the checksums of tablebase files
before use, if only for transmission errors.

Correctness: The test suite compares the probe results of random and hand
picked positions with multiple independent implementations (in other
languages). The library has also been used by researchers and players
(through the https://lichess.org/analysis#explorer and
https://syzygy-tables.info frontends) for years, without reported
inconsistencies.

I am gradually less confident in the implementation of variant tablebases,

This small crate implements Windows-style and Unix-style shell escaping.
Its not clear which exactly are the supported shells, so its hard
to guarantee the escaping is safe for all possible ones (although it
looks fine for all common shells).

A second worry is the runtime detection of the current shell, where an
environment variabe (MSYSTEM) can be used to change the escaping style to
Unix. For users of the crate, if the environment is known, I would recommend
explicitly specifying it, instead of relying on the detection.

The exposed functions have the signature Cow<str> -> Cow<str>. It would seem
that &str -> Cow<str> is more natural.

I do not know if character encodings play a role, here, and if str is the
correct type to be working with."""

## Fundamental

* [x] Well maintained?
  * Maintained by the Tokio project
* [x] Well documented?
* [x] Sane dep tree?
  * Build dependency on `autocfg` and optional dependency on `serde` :)
* [x] Good test coverage?
  * Good when including the unstable `--doctests` option
  * 90.7% line coverage with `cargo +nightly llvm-cov --doctests`
* [x] Tests are passing?
* [x] `cargo audit` is happy?

## Nice to have

* [x] `cargo check` is happy?
* [x] `rustfmt` is happy?
* [x] `clippy` is happy?
  * Happy on 1.66.1 at least
* [x] No outdated deps?

## Build scripts

* [x] Build script(s) seem sane?
  * Only used to gate off `cfg`s for different rust versions

## `unsafe` Review

* [x] Directly uses `unsafe`?
* [x] Passes `miri` if using `unsafe`?
  * `unsafe` methods are tested and this is enforced with CI

Only uses `unsafe` to expose three unsafe methods on `Slab`

`Slab::get_unchecked()` is just an analog to `[T]::get_unchecked()` and
internally calls `[T]::get_unchecked()` on the underlying vector. The caller
MUST call this method on an occupied entry within the bounds of the underlying
vector. Calling it outside of bounds is undefined behavior while calling it on
a `Vacant` entry will panic (hits `unreachable!()`) although this may be
relaxed to `unreachable_unchecked()` in the future a la
https://github.com/tokio-rs/slab/issues/40

`Slab::get_unchecked_mut()` is the same situation as `Slab::get_unchecked()`.
Also an analog of the slice method and also the same UB and panic behavior

`Slab::get2_unchecked_mut()` provides a way to get a mutable reference to two
elements in the `Slab` without bounds checking. This has the same invariants
as the other two (UB if out of range and panics on `Vacant` entries) along
with the additional invariant that the two elements have to be different to
prevent multiple mutable references to the same element. The last invariant is
enforced with a debug assert. Because there is no analog for slices this
manually implements the addressing in a similar way to
`[T]::get_unchecked_mut()` although it would be nice to have a debug assert
that the indices are in range (the standard library uses
`assert_unsafe_precondition!()` to do this on `[T]::get_unchecked()` and
`[T]::get_unchecked_mut()` which gets picked up by `cargo-careful`)

## General Review

`lib.rs`

Essentially a `Vec` where removed elements get replaced by a vacant entry
marker instead of shifting down all later values to compact. All vacant
entries store an index pointing to some other vacant entry with the last
vacant entry pointing to the end of the `Slab`. The `Slab` itself then stores
a `next` value pointing to the top of the stack so that it can keep track of
where all vacant entries are to efficiently push on new values. These
underlying entries are never publicly exposed to prevent users from mangling
this stack

Overall everything looks good. The `Slab` seems to correctly maintain its
invariants at all times and there is a nice sprinkling of asserts and debug
asserts to handle sanity checking

`serde.rs`

Contains the optional `serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}` impls for `Slab`. It
just (de)serializes as a map with the deserialization performing the same
operations as the `FromIterator` implementation"""

I am the author of this crate. As such, I obviously trust it and believe it is useful.
So this review will instead point at the trickiest parts and try to rationalize them.

First and foremost, a caution: `YOLO_RC_HEAP_LAYOUT_KNOWN` is unsound, don't use it.
It isn't public API nor documented API, but it does create \"working\" code that only
happens to work for the current compiler and relies on too many implementation details.

This crate provides a completely safe API through SliceWithHeader.
Prefer using it to the unsafe APIs that power it.

It should be noted that this crate's unsafety is purely on slice dst construction.
Once the slice dst has been manually allocated into a `Box`, everything becomes safe again.
Rust actually supports these trailing-slice DSTs perfectly well,
it is only construction that is unsafe.

Triomphe also provides a HeaderSlice<HeaderWithLength<Header>, [Item]> equivalent to slice-dst's
SliceWithHeader<Header, Item>. Slice-dst's is usable with std smart pointers, wheras triomphe's
is only usable with triomphe::Arc (and variants). Triomphe, however, is more battle tested.

Smoke tests are run under miri, but the crate could potentially do with some more examples
as well as some more tests to ensure that all of the functionality works as advertised.

I've only put this review as positive rather than strong because of a lack of real-world use.
As of yet, the library is just of theoretical use, and has yet to be stress tested for real."""

Careful auditing gives a good idea for what the actual API requirements of `UnprotectedStorage` are, and it's a doozy.

1. VecStorage makes it unsound to not call `clean`
2. Noop `clean`s on several storages make me think it should consume `self` instead of taking `&mut self` - maybe can't due to API limitations?
3. Need clearer UnprotectedStorage docs

**EDIT**: The found unsoundness is reported as vulnerability (RUSTSEC-2019-0023).
This is already fixed in 0.7.1, so you should use 0.7.1 or above.

* * *

I've found unsoundness and reported it: <https://github.com/Robbepop/string-interner/issues/9>.
This is use after free, but user cannot access that dangling pointer directly,
and invalid write access will not happen.
This issue is caused by `StringInterner::clone()` followed by `StringInterner::{get,get_or_intern}`,
so this would affect many use cases.
This is the reason of negative rating.

Except for that issue, there seems no problem.

* `unsafe` at line 125 is safe thanks to `assert!` at the previous line.
* `unsafe` at line 165 is safe because
    + `InternalStrRef`s are immutable,
    + they have `*const str` referring inside private `Vec<Box<str>>`, and
    + `InternalStrRef`s are not taken or copied to the outside of `StringInterner` type.
    + (It is unsafe that `InternalStrRef` refers string owned by another interner instance,
      and it is reported as stated above.)

The whole idea of the crate -- having a variable unitialized for a while,
then return something back later on seems a bit unnatural for the whole Rust
type system. This can be seen by the fact that certain cornercases are
handled by not merely panicking, but outright aborting the whole process.

I didn't manage to find a way to break safety guarantees using the crate and
I tried to find a loophole quite hard. But considering how questionable
things it does, I'd really like to see some kind of proof or semi-formal
argument saying why it is safe. Such thing is not included in the source
code, unfortunately.

The repository doesn't seem to have a recent activity and the last release is
2 years ago, but it's hard to say if it's abandoned or simply considered
finished.

I've also found a resource leak (that is somewhat unlikely to get triggered
in real-world usage).

Therefore, I'd be somewhat wary using this myself and would need a good
reason to reach for this crate -- certainly not just for convenience.

Solid crate overall.

Concerns:
* Absurdly high default `NUM_RETRIES` means this crate can hang.
* Slightly unnecessarily large unsafe use, used once without clear need.
* TempDir seems like a big footgun.
* Well documented footguns with regards to share tmp dirs on some systems.
* Hazard to reproducable builds thanks to random filename generation.

This crate was written by Amanieu d'Antras in response to my efforts to make
thread safe caching in the regex crate faster. The way to think about it is
\"dynamic\" thread local storage.

The crate does use a fair amount of unsafe, and the reason for this is to
minimize latency as much as is possible. Each use of unsafe isn't
particularly tricky---it's mostly managing atomic access to a hash table.
With that said, it would be nice if each use of unsafe had a comment
explaining/justifying it. There are some comments scattered about making
reasonable arguments, but more would be good.

This crate did have an issue a while back where if a program used the same
regex (for example) many times from many short lived threads, then the
cached data could grow without bound. Amanieu patched that issue a while
back by reusing thread ids. A thread id is tracked using normal TLS, which
is dropped when the thread is destroyed.

I gave this crate a rating of positive because I cannot identify any issues
after reviewing the code, although, I am not completely certain that there
are no issues because of the use of unsafe code.

Very focussed `forbid(unsafe)` crate.

The minor flaws are introduced by trying to mimic the std interface too much
and too quickly. This leads to some misbehaviour in remove and drain, several
known slowness issues—algorithmic complexity as well as efficiency of
operations—and poorly documented interfaces with slightly non-standard panic
behaviour, and unknown decision making for adding them.

Why implement `fmt::*` interface when the standard library does not for Vec?
How can Extend be called without risking panicking?

No safety critical flaws though and I expect most to be fixable within the
interface that was published (except the abundance of trait impls that is a
matter of taste)."""

Best summarized as a flood of unsafe blocks.

The `src/lib.rs` already looks somewhat suspicious. We have a thread local
containing a pointer that is unsafely accessed. It is set by transmuting a
local reference to a dynamic trait object which has its lifetime erased. This
particular portion might be fine if no code that uses the trait depends on
that lifetime. However, all of this is worryingly done without any statement
of purpose, any reference to the overall structure, and little to no
comments.

Then we look into `src/scheduler.rs` and find our worst nightmares come to
life. Here's a short list of unexplained stuff:

* uncommented impls of Sync and Send 
* an adhoc implementation of an intrusive queue/linked-list, giving a blog
  post about C (!) as the source. Maybe one of the better sources, I do not
  know, but it appears somewhat unmotivated and is intertwined with the rest of
  the code.
* several different UnsafeCell that have been encapsulated with telepathy,
  apparently, since there are no comments explaining them nor their access.
* unsafe blocks spanning ~70 lines
* and the amazing unsafe fn ptr2arc<T>(ptr: *const T) -> Arc<T>  containing

  ```rust
  let anchor = mem::transmute::<usize, Arc<T>>(0x10);
  ```

  without further explanation. Note that `T` is a type parameter that is
  exposed to the user through the type parameter `P` of `CurrrentThread`.
  This is restricted to `tokio-executor::park::Park` and provides an
  associated type which is later used as the `T` in question. Note that a
  public constructor exists.

  This is slightly unsound at best, if the node must be aligned to more than
  that function guarantees, and horrible with regards to how the pointer is
  used as a manual memoffset calculation afterwards.

* The part where `Node` is used to ignore the lifetime of a contained object
  and only its Drop implementation double panicking protects against using and
  dropping the object out of its own lifetime is the least worrying here. Also,
  since the comment refers to some type parameter `T` that doesn't exist in the
  impl."""

CI coverage is good, running both rustfmt and clippy on every push,
regardless of branch. It does not seem to run specifically on pull requests,
which, _I believe_, leads to Github not checking the merge commit
specifically but instead just individual commits on the remote branch. Not
too consequential in any case, just slightly unorthodox.

Since 0.2.0 (the previous review) decoding has been added which seems to have
resulted in an additional internal dependency (bit_field) that has _not_ yet
reached `1.0`. However, it remained stable for the past year. It's not
immediately clear why a simple shift-and-mask would not be clean enough here,
the traits provided by the dependency seem much more relevant if they help
enable an interface or generic implementation—which is both not required
here.

The decode interface looks sound and decently usable. There is an interesting
difference in that its `_with` variant returns a count on success whereas the
encoding methods do not. Additionally, it's unclear how to efficiently and
properly react to an `OverflowError` because neither the number of
successfully consumed input nor the actually required output would be
available to the caller.

The encode interface is unchanged since `0.2.0`. Thus I'm preserving the
previous review.

Contains unsafe code as a mechanism to eliminate bounds checks by asserting
properties with unreachable_unchecked. However, this appears to make proper
(and only proper) use of the unsafe assertion that strings are valid UTF-8
given by the standard library.

The unsafe code is documented and the reasoning behind it is explained. The
only minor flaw is that it does not properly explain that the validity
invariant used is being tested for. Since it does reference both utf-8 and
the byte length in its argument this should be straightforward to the reader
though.

A slightly cleaner way of testing the conditions might have been matching the
first byte with integer ranges, which would have eliminated the last bounds
check without an additional unreachable assertion.

No `strong` rating due to superficially unimportant dependency, and concerns
about the maturity of the interface (see above).

It remains unclear if an iterator based design instead of callbacks was
considered, potentially placing control flow in the hands of the caller. This
may be important for some cases where buffers need to be flushed while
efficiently preserving the decoding state."""

`Header::new` is unsound? This `unsafe` there seem unneccessary in the first place. There's not much performance to gain here.


`Header: value` - there can be more spaces preceeding the value. `Header::from_str` could take a `HeaderName:     Value` \"The field value MAY be preceded by any amount of LWS, though a single SP is preferred. \" (https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2)


```
pub fn add_header(headers: &mut Vec<Header>, header: Header) {
    if !header.name().to_lowercase().starts_with(\"x-\") {
```

Probably can be done faster by just comparing slice with `eq_ignore_ascii_case`, instead of allocating a lowercase copy.



`src/lib.rs`: Tests doing http calls to external network can fail on offline machines, are a potential privacy problem etc.



`PoolKey::new` - failing to get a port should probably be an error, since that means te scheme was neither http nor https, so why are we even handling it?


`Unit` indeed is a so-so name. If the comment is \"unit of work\" then it probably should be `UnitOfWork`.


```
    // pointer to underlying stream
    stream: *mut Stream,
```

Ouch. When I see mutable raw pointers, I already know that I will not be using this code as is. :D . From what I can see later, it seems this pointer is used just for the drop implementation? In that case, just use `Option<Stream>` or `Option<Box<Stream>>`. `Option<Box<T>>` even compiles down to the same data/code as nullable pointer.


I fail to see the point of `Request::build`...


`Request::query` and `query_str` seems silent about the matter of escaping, and I wonder if it will work correctly at all.


`Request::timeout` ... Deadlines are better than timeouts, and are not harder to implement.


`    index: (usize, usize), // index into status_line where we split: HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

I see no reason, why these two would be touple, instead of being separate and named appropriatly.


`Response::new` works by ... parsing? I don't know how I feel about that. Seems wasteful.



```
    /// Rather than exposing a custom error type through results, this library has opted
    /// for representing potential connection/TLS/etc errors as HTTP response codes.
    /// These invented codes are called \"synthetic\".
```

I don't know how I feel about this. Seems like a bad idea. :D . It will lead to confusion during debugging eg. by people who don't know about this \"feature\" (eg. DevOps that will be reading logs of software that is using this library). They will see \"error: 535\", and wonder how the hell this code happened.


`        let mut yolo = YoloRead {` does not build confidence. :D


```
pub(crate) struct YoloRead {
    stream: *mut Stream,
    dealloc: bool, // whether we are to dealloc stream on drop
}
```


Oh. Here is another `*mut Stream`. I don't really get why it is neccessary.
```
    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes().to_owned();
```

I don't think this clone is neccessary. 


Generally - negative review, since there's some `unsafe` code that I don't think is neccessary, and I have
no confidence that it is actually correct (quite the opposite... I suspect some stuff is wrong with it).

There were some other minor problems, potentially bugs, a lot of casual needless cloning and
stuff that looks like plain inefficiencies, and generally this crate at its current state does not look
like something I'd recommend for any serious production use. The goal seems good but it seem not there yet.
I think crates like this need either a lot of usage and pair of eyes and developers to iron out all the details,
or some extensive test suite.

being capped at ≈49 days, which I reported:

uses a stored copy of WolfSSL that was downloaded directly from their github

As it is a raw C binding, the functions are all 'unsafe' and that should be taken
into account before considering the crate as it."""

0.5.3:  Replaced libflate with flate2, minor touchups.  LGTM.
0.5.2:  Looks like a solid crate.  A few minor concerns:

* 755 permissions.  Necessary, but bandied about.
* Unsanitized path names are accessible, easy to misuse.
* Doesn't ban access to `CON` or similar.
* Lacks fuzz tests
